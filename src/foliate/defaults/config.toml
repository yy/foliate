# Foliate Configuration
# This file configures your static site build.
# All settings have sensible defaults - customize only what you need.
#
# This is YOUR config - personalize it for your site!

[site]
# Site name (appears in browser title, metadata)
name = "My Site"

# Full URL where the site will be deployed (used for sitemaps, social cards)
url = "https://example.com"

# Author name (used in metadata)
author = ""

# Default image for social media previews (Open Graph, Social media cards)
# Relative to assets/ directory
default_og_image = "/assets/images/default-preview.png"


[build]
# Folders to completely ignore during build (checked at any path depth)
# Files in these folders are never processed, regardless of frontmatter
ignored_folders = ["_private"]

# Where to redirect the site root (/)
# This page should exist in _homepage/ with public: true
home_redirect = "about"

# Special directory for homepage content (deployed to site root instead of /wiki/)
homepage_dir = "_homepage"

# URL prefix for wiki content (e.g., "wiki" -> /wiki/PageName/)
# Set to empty string "" to deploy wiki content at root
wiki_prefix = "wiki"

# Enable incremental builds (only rebuild changed files)
incremental = true


[visibility]
# Foliate uses a two-tiered visibility system:
#
# In your markdown frontmatter:
#   public: true      - Page is built and accessible via direct link
#   published: true   - Page also appears in listings and search
#
# Examples:
#   ---
#   public: true
#   ---
#   → Built, accessible at /wiki/page-name/, but not in listings
#
#   ---
#   public: true
#   published: true
#   ---
#   → Built AND visible in listings, search, recent pages


[nav]
# Header navigation items
# Each item needs: url, label
# Optional: logo (image path), logo_alt (alt text)
items = [
    { url = "/about/", label = "About" },
    { url = "/wiki/Home/", label = "Wiki" },
]


[footer]
# Footer settings
copyright_year = 2026
author_name = ""
author_link = "about/"


[deploy]
# Deployment settings for `foliate deploy`
# method = "github-pages"  # Currently only github-pages is supported
# target = "../my-site.github.io"  # Path to your GitHub Pages repository
# exclude = ["CNAME", ".gitignore", ".gitmodules", ".claude"]  # Files to preserve in target


[advanced]
# Quarto preprocessing (for .qmd files)
# Requires: uv add foliate[quarto]
quarto_enabled = false
quarto_python = ""  # Path to Python interpreter for Quarto, or empty for default
